# Basic MERN App

## Dependencies:

- MongoDB Atlas as the database
- Express.js as the server
- React.js as the client
- Node.js as the runtime environment (to set up models, routes
  and controllers)
- Mongoose for better json connectivity
- cors for cross-origin resource sharing that is required for the client and server to communicate
- dotenv for environment variables

## Steps of a basic MERN App

### BACK-END

1. **Setup MongoDB Atlas**

- Create a new cluster
- Create a new user
- Get the connection string to be used in server.js (express)

2. **Setup Express.js Server**

- Create a new express app using npx create-react-app
- create a backend folder
- Create a .env file to store environment variables (URI for atlas)
- Install nodemon to automatically restart the server when changes are made
- Install required packages (express, mongoose, cors, dotenv)
- A package.json file gets created to set up scripts for the server
- Create a server.js file to set up the server
- Set up the server to connect to MongoDB Atlas
- Create Models (db objects) for objects (user, exercises in this case)
- Create routes for the server (for get and post requests)
- Create controllers for the server (to handle the logic of the routes)

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
